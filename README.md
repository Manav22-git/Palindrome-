# Palindrome-
Palindrome Number Checker
This Python script defines a function to check whether a given integer is a palindrome.

What is a Palindrome Number?
A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward and backward. For example:

121 is a palindrome because reversing it gives 121.

-121 is not a palindrome due to the negative sign.

10 is not a palindrome because reversing it gives 01.

How the Code Works
The function converts the integer to a string.

It compares the string with its reverse.

If both are the same and the number is non-negative, it returns True.

Otherwise, it returns False.
